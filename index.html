        <p>Secret Islands:
    Sure, family trips to New York City can be a blast, but there aren’t too many beautiful islands to check out, aside from that one big one. Florida has plenty of lesser-known islands off of the Gulf Coast that will make you feel like you’re in a movie about relaxation. These islands are terrific for romantic getaways or just family bonding near the water. You and your family deserve the best, and relaxing on an island definitely qualifies as the best. Even better, you can vacation on these islands without spending thousands of dollars per night on hotels and resorts.

        </p><p>Amazing Vacation Resorts: 
    Florida is home to some of the most amazing hotels and resorts, and your family can enjoy whichever ones you desire. You will truly be treated like kings and queens and will only be upset with how soon you have to leave. Many of these beautiful resorts are just minutes away from some of Florida’s greatest attractions, as well.</p>

        <p>The Beaches, the Weather, and the People:
    Wherever you are in Florida, you’re never more than 60 miles away from a beautiful beach that’s filled with smiling faces. From fellow vacationers to the friendly locals, everyone is so calm and relaxed throughout the Sunshine State. It’s nearly impossible to not be at ease when the weather is phenomenal, the beaches are beautiful, and everyone is smiling.</p>
